## Download scope2d Installer

### Install on Windows

- Download the [Windows 64 bit installer](https://github.com/bilgilid/scope2d/releases/download/1.0.0/scope2dSetup.exe) and run it
- Open the folder it creates (i.e. `scope2dSetup`)
- Run the `setup.exe` file in the folder and follow the instructions

Notes:
- Your antivirus will probably want to scan the installer executables and the application's executable on first use. Let the antivirus scan the executables and then use the program.
