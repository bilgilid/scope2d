Qt (5.8.0 or newer) needs to be installed on your system as qmake is necessary to build scope2d.

Other dependencies are;

Eigen (3.3.4 or newer),
Qwt (6.1.3 or newer)

1. Open either scope2d_release.pro or scope2d_debug.pro depending on the build type you want

2. Set EIGENDIR to your installation location of Eigen library.

3. Set QWTDIR to your installation location of Qwt library.

4. Start a Terminal

5. Change directory to this directory (i.e. <YOUR_PATH>/build/make-linux)

6. Run 

qmake scope2d_release.pro

OR

qmake scope2d_debug.pro

depending on which build you want; release or debug

7. Run

make

8. When the build is completed, you will find scope2d in ../x64/Release or ..x64/Debug, depending on the build type you chose
